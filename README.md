# CLUSTERING-ALORITHM
THE IRIS IS A DATASET IS A RENOWED COLLECTION USED EXTENSIVELY FOR TESTING MACHINE LEARNING ALOGRITHMS. IT CONSISTS OF 150SAMPLES,EACH REPRENTATION.
ONE OF THREE SPECIES OF IRIS FLOWERS: IRIS_SETOSA, IRIS-VERSICOLOR, IRIS-VIRGINICA.
IN THIS STUDY, THE DATASET WAS SUBJECTED TO CLUSTERING USING TWO DIFFERENT ALGRITHMS. KMEANS AND HIERARCHICAL CLUSTERING.BOTH ALGORITHMS ARE COMMONLY APPLIED IN CLASSIFICATION TASKS, AND WHILE KMEANS SEEMS TO PROVIDE A MORE ACCURATE GROUPING IN THIS CASE,
HIERARCHICAL CLUSTERING CAN REVEAL CAN REVEAL ADDITIONAL RELATIONSHIPS THAT MIGHT BE BENEFICIAL FOR MORE COMPLEX DATA ANALYSIS.
